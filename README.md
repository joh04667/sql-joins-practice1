Practice on adjunct tables in SQL

1. Get all customers and their addresses.
 ```sql 
        SELECT * FROM addresses JOIN customers ON addresses.customer_id = customers.id
 ```

2. Get all orders and their line items.
 ```sql 
        SELECT * FROM orders JOIN line_items ON line_items.order_id = orders.id
```

3. Which warehouses have cheetos?
 ```sql
        SELECT warehouse.warehouse, products.description
        FROM warehouse
        JOIN warehouse_product ON warehouse.id = warehouse_product.warehouse_id
        JOIN products ON warehouse_product.product_id = products.id
        WHERE products.description IN ('cheetos');
```

4. Which warehouses have diet pepsi?
```sql
        SELECT warehouse.warehouse, products.description
        FROM warehouse
        JOIN warehouse_product ON warehouse.id = warehouse_product.warehouse_id
        JOIN products ON warehouse_product.product_id = products.id
        WHERE products.description IN ('diet pepsi');
```

5. Get the number of orders for each customer.
```sql
        SELECT first_name, last_name, COUNT(line_items.quantity)
        FROM customers
        JOIN addresses ON customers.id = addresses.customer_id
        JOIN orders ON addresses.id = orders.address_id
        JOIN line_items ON orders.id = line_items.order_id
        GROUP BY first_name, last_name;
```

6. How many customers do we have?
```sql
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS "customer count"
        FROM customers;
```

7. How many products do we carry?
```sql
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS "product count"
        FROM products;
```

8. What is the total available on-hand quantity of diet pepsi?
```sql
        SELECT description, SUM(warehouse_product.on_hand)
        FROM products
        JOIN warehouse_product ON products.id = warehouse_product.product_id
        WHERE description IN ('diet pepsi')
        GROUP BY description;
``` 

there is a bug with these numbers and it is really annoying me
